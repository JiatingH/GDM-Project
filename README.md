# GDM-Project
R codes summary of paper: Integrative Metagenomic  and Metabolomic Analysis Reveal Gut Microbiota-Derived Multiple Hits Connected to Development of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in Humans

This is a R code record for GDM project
1. Differential_Abundance_Analysis.r is used for exploring the species with differentail abundance between GDM and NGT participants.
2. Diversity_Analysis.r is used for the exploration of beta diversity and alpha diversity.
3. PAPi_Score_Calculation.r is for calculation of PAPi Activity Score of metabolic pathways based on the metabolites abundance.
4. RF_model_and_SHAP.r is used to build the RF model based on species relative abundance and apply SHAP to calculate the importance score of the species in the predicting the metabolic pathway.
5. Selbal.r is used to explore the gut species balance between GDM and NGT.
6. SPLS_Analysis.r aims to correlate the relative abundance of species, the relative abundance of metabolites, the PAPi score of metabolic pathways and the clinical phenotype.
